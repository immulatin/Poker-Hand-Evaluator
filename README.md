The program expects one hand to be passed in to be evaluated. You can run this by passing that argument into
the main class (PokerHandRank.java). Make sure to enclose the hand in quotes so that it is passed in as one
argument.

As a convenience the project is also configured for maven. So if maven is accessible you can build the jar and run
the program via command line.

Instructions to build and run the jar are:
1. Run 'mvn clean install' from the top level folder of the project.
2. Run the jar "java -jar target/poker-exercise.jar 'Ak 2s 4c 10s Qh'".
